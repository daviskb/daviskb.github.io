In this project, I focused primarily on the development of different enemy types, their behavior, and their
interactions with the level around them, along with various other aspects such as custom level design, missiles, and
a cheat mode.

Used C# and Unity for development.

</ul>

In this project, I created a puzzle platformer from scratch, focusing primarliy on the custom mechanic
which allows the player to record their actions. The player can interact with this past recording, allowing for
interesting puzzle solving. I focused primarily on implementing this mechanic and using the pub-sub system.

Used C# and Unity for development.
